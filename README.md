UVA-Problem-Solutions
=====================

This repository represents my solutions to many programming problems from
The UVA Online Judge (http://uva.onlinejudge.org/),
The Programming Contest Training Manual (http://www.programming-challenges.com/pg.php?page=index),
and The Offical ACM-International Collegiate Programming Competition Archive (http://www.programming-challenges.com/pg.php?page=index).

Currently, most of my solutions are in Java or C. At the beginning of each solution, I describe my approach and any difficulties or
tough edge cases. My solutions also contain lots of comments, and are (for the most part) well-written code. This is in sharp
contrast to most solutions you can find on the web, which I hope some people may find useful.
